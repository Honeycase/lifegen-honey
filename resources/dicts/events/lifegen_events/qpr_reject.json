        "One quiet night, qpp1 tells you how much fun they have when you're together, and asks if you'd like to be platonic partners with them. While you love qpp1, you're not sure you're ready to be more than just regular friends, so you say no. qpp1 looks disappointed, but insists that they're not. They're a bit quieter for the rest of the night."

        "Over a meal one afternoon, qpp1 nonchalantly asks how you'd feel about partnering up with them-- like mates, but only platonic. You love qpp1 as a friend very much, but, not feeling ready for an extra level of commitment to that, you tell them no. Shock flickers in their gaze for a moment before they quietly return to their meal. They don't talk to you for a bit after that, feelings undoubtedly hurt."
