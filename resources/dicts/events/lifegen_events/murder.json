You're an elder now, but your warrior's spirit still burns bright. Under the cover of night, you end v_c's reign. Dawn breaks, unveiling your actions. Maybe now, a true mediator will rise."

You're so stubborn, in fact, that you don't release v_c's throat until you're completely and utterly sure there's no chance of {PRONOUN/v_c/object} ever saying another word again."
