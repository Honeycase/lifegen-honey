        "It has been a while since some of the clan has polished their training skills. You gather a group of established warriors to the training grounds and dedicate the day to refining their battle tactics, fighting moves, and cooperation with one another. ",
        "You take a rare moment of peace to spend some time roaming the territory. It had been a while since you were able to take a peaceful stroll for yourself. ",
        "l_n approaches you, requesting you to join them in the leader's den to confer about some private matters regarding the clan. You nod and follow them inside, hoping you can assist them with your own insight.",
        "You catch r_w trotting up to you. They've just returned from a patrol and make sure to give you the details on their findings. You nod gratefully for their report, advising them to grab a piece of fresh kill before dismissing them.",
        "The sun had barely risen as you wake r_w1, r_w2, and r_w3 for the dawn patrol that morning. You decide it best to lead this patrol yourself, not wanting too many of the warriors to be exhausted later in the day for future patrols.",
        "r_w waves their tail at you in parting as they lead their band of cats out of camp for the dusk patrol. You can only hope that you made the right choices for the patrol.",
        "r_m walks up to you, wondering if there is a warrior that can accompany them as they head out of camp. You take a moment to assess who may be available in camp, before settling on r_w.",
        "l_n consults you about who may be best to mentor r_k when they reach six moons.",
        "You check in with r_q during the kit's afternoon nap. They are grateful for your attentiveness, and the two of you get a few tasks done before the sleeping kittens awake.",
        "You take some time to check in with r_m. They inform you of a few den repairs and advise an area to keep the patrols away from to avoid unnecessary injuries. You're grateful for the insight and organize r_w1 and r_w2 to fix up the den.",
        "As you come back with a hunting patrol, r_k and a few others surround you with questions about how the patrol went. You indulge them with a smile."

    "You approach l_n about strengthing the borders. You feel it is necessary to show off a united front about the matter. l_n listens very carefully and agrees. The two of you call a meeting for c_nClan.",
    "r_w sees it fit to question your decisions regarding patrols. You shut down the argument swiftly and succinctly, leading to amusement from the other warriors as r_w licks their chest in embarrassment.",
    "You take initiative after scenting a loner on patrol with r_w and r_w2. When the loner is found you relish the feeling of telling them to stay out - or else.",
    "r_m has complained of needing extra paws while gathering herbs. You don't want to take away from your supply of warriors, so you suggest they ask an apprentice or elder to assist. r_m is less than pleased but that isn't your problem.",
    "You strike out on your own today with pep in your step. However, it's not long at all before you catch r_a clumsily tracking you. You are quick to confront them and scold them to StarClan and back for their lack of skill. If they were going to track you, they should have at least done it well."

Your voice cuts through the air and you aggressivly scorn the warrior. Later you report back to l_n and request that the apprentice trains under you for the time being.",

One that's filled with original songs written by the mediators, props made by the medicine cats and costumes designed by the apprentices.
